# es2015-programming-challenges
Some basic common programming challenges with ES2015 solutions

## 1. [Reverse](src/01_reverse.js)
For the given sentence "Done is better than perfect” return the reversed
sentence “Perfect than better is done"

## 2. [FizzBuzz](src/02_fizzbuzz.js)
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the
multiples of five print "Buzz".
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## 3. [Palindrome](src/03_palindrome.js)
For a given string, check to see if it is a Palindrome.
For "racecar" it should return `true`. For "apple" it should return `false`.

## 4. [O'clock](src/04_oclock.js)
Write a program that given a time (in hours and minutes) gives you the degree of
the angle between the hands on the clock.

## 5. [The sum](src05_thesum.js)
You have an array with N integers and you should write a program to find two
elements with given sum K

## 6. Zero Sky Diving (TODO)
You are given an array of integers. Write an algorithm that brings all nonzero
elements to the left of the array, and returns the number of nonzero elements

## 7. Fib yo! (TODO)
Implement a function to output the nth value in the Fibonacci sequence.
